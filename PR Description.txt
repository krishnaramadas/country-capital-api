Customer Notification via Whatsapp

#What?
I've added support for authentication to implement Customer notification via whatsapp.

#Why?
These changes adds extra authetication to the user login and account creation experience

#Notes
Let's consider using a 3rd party authentication provider for this. Let's also consider breaking this out into its own service. 
We can then re-use it or share the accounts with other apps in the future.
